I try to make a simple web crawler by python. :)

It will be made with [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup) library.


And I will write the progress.

If you have any idea or suggest to my code, please write your comment on the article whenever (DISQUS).
- I don't know above sentence is correct or not. LOL


Thank you.
